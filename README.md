# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

Lending service companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. Two different machine learning models, the Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Classifier, were created using this data to classify the risk level of given loans. Their respective perfomance were compared and discussed in the Credit Rsik Evaluator jupyter notebook within the 'Solution' folder.

The dataset for this challenge was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
